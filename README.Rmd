## Background

The lavaan package is an excellent package for structural equation models, and the DiagrammeR package is an excellent package for producing nice looking graph diagrams. As of right now, the lavaan package has no built in plotting functions for models, and the available options from external packages don't look as nice and aren't as easy to use as DiagrammeR, in my opinion. Of course, you can use DiagrammeR to build path diagrams for your models, but it requires you to build the diagram specification manually. This package exists to streamline that process, allowing you to plot your lavaan models directly, without having to translate them into the DOT language specification that DiagrammeR uses.

## Installation

You can install lavaanPlot from CRAN with:

```{r, eval = F}
install.packages("lavaanPlot")
```

You can also install the development version of lavaanPlot from GitHub with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("alishinski/lavaanPlot")
```

## Examples

Here's a quick example using the `mtcars` data set. 

First fit your lavaan model. The package supports plotting lavaan regression relationships and latent variable - indicator relationships.

```{r}
library(lavaan)
library(lavaanPlot)

model <- 'mpg ~ cyl + disp + hp
          qsec ~ disp + hp + wt'

fit <- sem(model, data = mtcars)
summary(fit)
```

Then using that model fit object, simply call the `lavaanPlot` function, specifying your desired graph parameters.

```{r}
lavaanPlot(model = fit, node_options = list(shape = "box", fontname = "Helvetica"), edge_options = list(color = "grey"), coefs = F)
```

There is also functionality to save these plots as images and embed them in pdf output documents.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
model <- 'mpg ~ cyl + disp + hp
          qsec ~ disp + hp + wt'

fit <- sem(model, data = mtcars)

pl <- lavaanPlot(model = fit)

# Example for pdf embed
embed_plot_pdf(pl, "plot2.pdf")

# Example for saving to .png
save_png(pl, "plot.png")
```
